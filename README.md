<h3>A Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.</h3>

## So what is C2ME?
C^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) and [Starlight](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight).

## What does C2ME stand for?
Concurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.

## So what is C2ME not?
**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  
Although it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  
So backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.

[^forge_partial116]: Forge doesn't appear to support Java 16 on 1.16.5, so these versions uses Java 11 and may not contain some features which is present in the fabric versions.
